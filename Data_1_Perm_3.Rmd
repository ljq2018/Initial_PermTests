X1 and X2 are correlated, no beta3

Data_Type_1 <- function(beta0, beta1, beta2, beta3, beta4, n_obs, rep) {
  
 ###Define Variables 
 x1<- rnorm(n_obs) 
 x2<- x1 + rnorm(n_obs)

 y<- beta0 + beta1*x1 + beta2*x2 + rnorm(n_obs)

 ###Regress Y on X1 and X2

 obs_fit<- lm(y ~ x1 + x2)

 #what values do we want to record?
  output1 <- c(y,x1,x2)
