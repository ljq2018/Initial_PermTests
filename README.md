# Initial_PermTests
This is all the data generated from the first attempt to conduct extensive simulations in order to observe the behavior of permutation tests under various conditions.
There is one data file, "Full_Data_Thesis" which is a text file and can be opened in R using the "From Text (readr)" option under "Import Dataset." This data can be filtered by both data type (1, 2, 3 or C) and permutation method (1a, 1b, 2, or 3) in order to see the results of individual simulations (for example, data acquired from "Data_Type_1_Perm_1a," and so forth).
